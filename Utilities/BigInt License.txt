-- Usage is pretty obvious.  bigint(n) constructs a bigint.  n can be
-- a number or a string.  The regular operators are all overridden via
-- metatable, and also generally work with regular numbers too.
-- Note that comparisons between bigints and numbers *don't* work.
-- bigint() uses a small cache, so bigint(constant) should be fast.
--
-- Only the basic operations are here.  No gcd, factorial, prime test, ...
--
-- Technical notes:
-- Primary difference from the C version is the obvious 1 indexing, this
-- shows up in a variety of ways and places, along with slightly different
-- handling of pre-allocated comps arrays.
-- I made a brief effort to sync some of the comments, but you're better
-- off just reading the C code.
